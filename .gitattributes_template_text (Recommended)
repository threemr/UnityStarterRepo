# Refreshing a repository after changing line endings:

# 	Save your current files in Git, so that none of your work is lost.
# 		$ git add . -u
# 		$ git commit -m "Saving files before refreshing line endings"
# 	Add all your changed files back and normalize the line endings.
# 		$ git add --renormalize .
# 	Show the rewritten, normalized files.
# 		$ git status
# 	Commit the changes to your repository.
# 		$ git commit -m "Normalize all the line endings"
